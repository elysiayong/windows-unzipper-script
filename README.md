# windows-unzipper-script
Sick and tired of unzipping zips within zips and within folders that are also within zips? Look no further!
This dumb program automatically unzips nested zips (like blender assets and stuff like that, very annoying) --It only works on windows btw

**Note: unzipper-unzip is NOT safe use unzipper-unzip-2 instead**
